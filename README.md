# ElectionExploration
Using Election Data to learn more about R and R Studio


I am starting this project both to learn more about R studio, Dyplyr and other
statistical coding that I need practice with, but also to learn how to publish
what I am working on in GitHub. This is the first project to a hopefully varying
future portfolio.
